# Tiny Guess

*A tiny number guessing game with a discrete math twist*

After the player finds the correct number, the game compares the number of guesses used with the optimal number of guesses from binary search.

Binary search is a classic algorithm that halves the remaining search space with each step. In the worst case, it finds the answer in about \log_{2}(N) tries.

This lets the player see how close their guessing strategy is to the mathematically optimal one.
